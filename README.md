This is a board-game style, (offline) two-player game. Share your computer with a friend, then take turns clicking the dice and playing the mini-game that follows. Winning will require both skill and luck. Skill because the other player automatically wins if you lose all your lives in the mini-games. Luck because you need it to skip over the trap squares and land perfectly on the winning square. Have fun :)

## Installation

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary packages. Then run `Game.py` to launch the game.

## How to Play

More detailed instructions are in-game.
